Here is the specifications of this job, I will also send other optimized reports that I have done previously
in order increase the performance of this expert advisor. During your backtesting please find optimized set files that out perform 
the reports that I send you in the four categories that are in the delverables.  

FX Striker 
* Simple moving average crossover trading system that uses dynamic support and resistance as take profit targets


Style of Trading 
* Intra-day and mild swing trading


Entry Strategy Buy
* Fast moving average crosses over slow moving average, entry will be open at the close of the candlestick 


Entry Strategy Sell
* Slow moving average crosses over fast moving average, entry will open at the close of the candlestick


Dynamic Support & Resistance 
* Indicator that measures the daily range of the market and projects new resistance (buy targets) and supports (sell targets). I will use those supports and resistance as buy/sell targets when an entry is triggered. NOTE* Take profit targets will be set based on the day that the trade was entered. 


Stop Loss 
* Fixed stop loss based on backtesting 


Risk/Reward Cutoff
* Add an option where the trade will be cancelled if the risk vs reward value is less than a 1:1


Take Profit Strategy 1 (Buy/Sell)
* Once triggered in 1 trade is entered buy/sell take profit 1 is the resistance/support (First red or green line past the pivot line which would be the purple line 


Take Profit Strategy 2 (Buy/Sell) 
* Once triggered in 2 trades are entered with one trade having a take profit of support/resistance 1 and the second trade is the resistance/support 2 (Second red or green line past the pivot line which would be the purple line)


Take Profit Strategy 3 (Buy/Sell)
* 3 Trades will be created when buy/sell are triggered the first trade take profit is support/resistance 1, the second trade take profit is support/resistance 2 and the third trade take profit is support/resistance 3




Trail Stops

Strategy 1 Trail 
* Should only be moved to break even after 50% of take profit 1 position has been hit (need to be option to adjust in settings)


Strategy 2 Trail 
* 2 trades are entered with take profits at support/resistance 1 & 2, after take profit 1 hit, then the stop loss of the second trade need to move to breakeven 

Strategy 3 Trail 
* 3 trades are entered with take profits at support/resistance 1,2 & 3 after take profit is hit, then the stop loss of the 2nd and 3rd trade move to breakeven, after take profit 2 is hit 
the stop loss for the third trade needs to be move to the value  of take profit 1. (Also you would need to make a setting where the stop loss would need to move to the value of support or resistance 2 
after it has reached a certain % difference between the price of take profit 2 and take profit 3. (Example if that percentage is set to 50% then once price has moved 50% of the distance between take profit 2 and 3 then
the stop loss needs to be moved to the price of support/resistance 2.


Entry Lot Size
* Each trade 1,2 or 3 needs to have a individual lot size and take profit location that can be adjusted in the setting 

(Example) 
1st trade Lot Size = 0.01
1st trade Take profit = Resistance/Support 1 

2nd trade Lot Size = 0.02
2nd trade Take Profit = Resistance/Support 2 

3rd trade Lot Size = 0.07
3rd trade Take Profit = Resistance/Support 3 

PIVOT POINT INDICATOR
- In the expert advisor code the pivots_point indicator needs to be place inside the expert advisor to automatically have the indicator display and give the take profit points for each day (support 1,2 & 3 the daily pivot and resistance 1,2 &3)
the support/resistance/pivots prices need to be displayed on the chart in the center of the line created

-In the parameter settings I would need to be able to change the colors of the support/resistance/pivot lines as well as changes the font color 

AUTOMATIC CANCELLATION OF SIGNAL

(Buy Cancellation)
Buy trade can be open if price be at least below second resistance. 

(Sell Cancellation)
Sell trade can be open if price be at least above second support.
