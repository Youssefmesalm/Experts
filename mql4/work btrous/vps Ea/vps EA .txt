We will need to keep track every time the indicator goes +1 or -1, because that is not tracked by the indicator itself, the indicator will show you when a number goes up by adding to the number already in place, example, if the indicator shows +13, then a -1 comes in, the indicator will show now +12, it went down one.

So the EA need to track this and make sales or buy orders based on this, example:

Lets say that we start with 0 at the beginning of the trading day, and the indicator is showing EURUSD 0, the a couple of minutes later it shows +1 so the EA will immediately buy EURUSD 0.01 ( fixed lot ), then the indicator shows another +1, then the indicator will buy another 0.01 and so on, but lets say later on the indicator starts to show -1, the indicator will then sell EURUSD 0.01 and so on

All of the trades will be kept open, and I'm going to be using a hedge account so i can have both open long and short trades at the same time.

BY THE END OF THE DAY WHEN TRADING STOPS, WE WILL RESSET TO ZERO AND START FRESH THE NEXT DAY.

SETTINGS I NEED FOR THE EA:

Time of day to start trading, and time of day to stop trading, this means STOP trading NOT CLOSE trades, all open orders will be kept.
Take profit and Stop loss based on ALL open positions.
Select which pairs I want to trade at the same time and what fixed lot i want to use for each pair.
I need a STOP NEW TRADES button so i can manually stop trading for whatever reason, BUT KEEP OPEN TRADES
I will need a STOP AND CLOSE button to stop the EA and close everything manually.










I want to be able to choose which currencies i want the EA to trade

Have that on the settings

The lots have to be fixed lots and i want to be able ot choose the lot size for every pair

Rember we will track which PAIRS have the +1 or -1, just like you see on the right side of the chart


The indicator already does the job, just need to track the +1 and -1 and trade accordingly
